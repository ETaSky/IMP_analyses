README

1. otutable_s2_nf.txt 
This table is constructed so that it can be used to generate alpha diversity and beta diversity using relative abundance but with whole number values to simulate sequence counts (relative abundance X 1000). “nf” because it has been NORMALIZED and FILTERED for low prevalence OTUs
    - this OTU table does NOT contain taxonomy information 
    - has been filtered to contain only samples that are also in mapping file
    - dropped bugs that are < 10% prevalent across samples
    - 95% correlated bugs have also been dropped out

	e.g. call load.data() and write the OTU out to a file
    
2. running bug base - add extra line at the top of OTUTABLE (there’s a bug for .txt files)

3. when running bug base to do single cell predictions in the style of PICRUST, run with options “-a -k -p” and copy/paste contents of bugbase/doc/16s_Kegg_Modules.txt as the command line parameter for -p. should also be able to leave out -m and -c parameters - currently a bug, tonya will fix. 10/17/16.
